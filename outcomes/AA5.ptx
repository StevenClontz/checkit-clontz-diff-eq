    <statement>
        <p>
For each ODE, describe an appropriate strategy to find its
general solution, and the features of the ODE that make
that strategy appropriate. (Do not fully solve these ODEs.)

        <ol>
            <xsl:for-each select="odes/*">
                <li>
                    <m><xsl:value-of select="ode"/></m>

        <ol>
            <xsl:for-each select="odes/*">
                <li>
The ODE is <xsl:value-of select="form"/>, so it can be solved
by <xsl:value-of select="strategy"/>.
