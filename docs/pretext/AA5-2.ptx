    <statement>
        <p>
For each ODE, describe an appropriate strategy to find its
general solution, and the features of the ODE that make
that strategy appropriate. (Do not fully solve these ODEs.)

  <answer>
        <ol>
                <li>
The ODE is linear first-order, so it can be solved by solving its homogeneous form and then using variation of parameters, or using an integrating factor.
                </li>
                <li>
The ODE is exact, so it can be solved by finding a potential function.
                </li>
                <li>
The ODE is linear homogeneous with constant coefficients, so it can be solved by using D-notation and factoring.
                </li>
                <li>
The ODE is linear constant-coefficient with a discontinuous function, so it can be solved by using Laplace transforms.
